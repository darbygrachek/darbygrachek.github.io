Hello! I’m a PhD candidate in linguistics at the University of Southern California, where I am advised by [Stephanie Shih](https://stephsus.github.io/). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of phonology and psycholinguistics, and one of the central goals of my work is to better understand the relationship between the lexicon and the phonological grammar using behavioral and computational methods. In other words how does the way we <i>access</i> words influence the way we <i>say</i> them? 

My research examines phonological exceptionality and how it relates to stored representations, especially in the case of morphologically complex words. I am also interested in how lexical processes (e.g. lexical access) shape the input supplied to the phonological grammar, and how variables such as frequency and phonological experience factor into these processes.
